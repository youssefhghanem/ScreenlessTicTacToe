# ScreenlessTicTacToe
Python Code for my group's project in a course callsed 'Interactions Beyond Screens': A screenless, wall-mounted TicTacToe game that utilizes a RasberryPi 5 to power a board of 18 LED's arranged in a 3x3 matrix on an Acrylic Board. The Game is controlled by 3 buttons that allow for a retro style interaction with no restrictions for time played.
